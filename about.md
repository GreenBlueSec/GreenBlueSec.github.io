# About Me

Hi, I’m **Abraham Judisch** a cybersecurity professional with a passion for defending critical infrastructure. I currently work as an Information Security Engineer at Hennepin Healthcare, where I focus on strengthening enterprise defenses, streamlining incident response, and advancing risk governance practices.

My journey into cybersecurity has taken me through roles in both the public and private sectors, including time at Kipsu Inc. and Ernst & Young. I bring a hybrid background in hands-on security operations, compliance, cloud architecture, and team enablement — all informed by my training in martial arts and professional services.
